# Folio Breaking Changes

## Summary
This RFC's purpose is to deliver to developers and other affected groups general guidelines for determining if a change within FOLIO is either breaking or non-breaking. 

## Motivation

The community currently has differing approaches to versioning, and this has lead to undesirable situations in the development process. In an attempt to reconcile these differing approaches to versioning, it is necessary to put forward a standard guidance on what is and is not a breaking change. This RFS seeks to help FOLIO developers and other affected groups know, with every release, what breaking changes have been made.

## Detailed Explanation/Design

### Terms

For the purposes of this RFC the following terms should be understood by these definitions.

- **Behavioral Change**: A functional change to the implementation which does not correspond to a change in the interface.  

    - For example, if circulation adds additional actions when receiving a request at /checkout such as sending notifications or checking fees/fines but continues to send the same response, the interface version will not change.

- **Breaking Change**: A change that requires a Major Version Change as per Semantic Versioning's requirements.

    - *See [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200)*

- **Communication Protocol**: the shape of a request or response either to or from a given endpoint

- **Data Model Change**: A change in implementation that will require the addition, modification or removal of tables, columns or JSON structures in the storage layer.

- **Direct Dependency (UI)**: A package or module that is explicitly required by a particular project in order to function at runtime.

- **Development Dependency (UI)**: A package or module that is explicitly required by a particular project in order to be built.

- **Endpoint**: The combination of a path, an HTTP Method and both optional and required query parameters.

- **Interface**: An API described by RAML or OpenAPI documentation that has at least one implementation in FOLIO. Interfaces only represent the communication protocol.

- **Implementation**: Code which is invoked when interacting with an Interface.

- **Operational Change**: A change in an implementation that affects system operators. Such as...

    |         Changes                 |                Examples                              |
    | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
    | __Infrastructural changes__     | An implementation requires Kafka, Postgres, etc.     |
    | __Non-infrastructural changes__ | An implementation requires Java v17, Node v16, etc. |
    | __Configurational changes__     | A change to environmental variables, etc.            |

### Specifics

This RFC defines changes made in FOLIO at the implementation or interface level as breaking and non-breaking. Not all possible changes can be enumerated here, so this document is not intended to provide an exhaustive list of changes. If a particular change is not covered by this document, developers are encouraged to seek the guidance of the TC. Because both implementations and interfaces are versioned independently of each other, this document will address breaking and non-breaking changes at both the implementation and interface levels.

Additional distinctions must be made for implementation and interface changes. For implementation changes we will differentiate between backend and front end. For interface changes we will differentiate between the communication protocol and the data model. 

Behavioral changes, though significant and worth addressing, are outside the scope of this RFC.

#### __What constitutes as a breaking change ?__
Throughout this RFC we will be discussing changes in terms of the following two categories

- What is a breaking change at the __implementation__ level?
- What is a breaking change at the __interface__ level?

We will not address what constitutes as a breaking change in the __behavioral__ level, though this will be an important topic to broach in the future.

### Clarifications

- Interfaces only represent the communication protocol, i.e. the shape of a request/response to/from a given endpoint. 
- Behavior changes are part of a implementation’s version, e.g. if circulation adds additional actions when receiving a request at /checkout such as sending notifications or checking fees/fines but continues to send the same response, the interface version will not change.

## Unresolved Topics

- Versioning of behavioral changes.
- This RFC offers guidence on what is or is not a breaking change, but does not address how our community should implement this guidence.
- Some changes to shared components within the UI could be considered breaking. This has not been addressed by this RFC.
- Search query syntax is not a part of the FOLIO interface specification, and therefore changes to an implementation's processing of query parameters are considered behavioral for the purposes of this RFC and will not be addressed. It is worth noting that search query syntax perhaps should be explicitly addressed by a FOLIO interface specification.
